# Escape_from_UNB
Long story short, this game is about a CS student trying to graduate (or escape) from his university life.

To download the game executable, please visit:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_sFOL5P93ZJTjVtSlRoeVJ2NUk/view?usp=sharing

And right click download the zip file.

Once downloaded, run "Escape from UNB.exe". Select the right screen resolution. I recommend using 1024 x 768 as the resolution.

The key controls are "Space" (to jump and skip scene), "W" (move forward), "A" (move left), "S" (move backward) and "D" (move right). Use the mouse to rotate your view.
